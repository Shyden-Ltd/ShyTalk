/**
 * Per-locale guard for the portal's ban screen (SHY-0149).
 *
 * Two things nothing else checks.
 *
 * 1. `scripts/check-orphan-i18n-keys.sh` proves a key is defined SOMEWHERE — it
 *    unions every locale block before comparing. Drop `banned_signout` from one
 *    locale and it still passes, because the other twenty define it. That
 *    locale's user then silently sees the raw key, or English.
 *
 * 2. `portal-a11y.spec.ts` only ever renders the default locale, so it proves a
 *    key is attached to exactly one DOM node — never that another locale's
 *    dictionary carries it.
 *
 * The ban screen shipped with `banned_heading` byte-identical to
 * `suspended_heading` in Russian; both states reading 封禁 ("banned") in Chinese;
 * and — caught only after a byte-equality check proved too weak — Ukrainian
 * saying `заблоковано` ("blocked") for BOTH, differing only in the noun for
 * "account". A banned user in any of those locales could not tell which state
 * their account was in, which is the entire purpose of the screen.
 *
 * So equality is not the test. Each locale declares the ROOT that means "ban"
 * and the ROOT that means "suspend", and each state's copy must contain its
 * own root and not the other's. That table is the specification: a translator
 * changing the copy must keep it true, and an engineer cannot satisfy it by
 * swapping a noun.
 *
 * A ROOT, not a whole word, because the copy shifts part-of-speech between
 * keys: the Russian heading says `забанен` (participle) but `banned_until`
 * says `Бан заканчивается:` (noun) — they share only the stem `бан`. A
 * whole-word table could therefore never cover the `_until` pair, and that
 * pair is precisely where `ru`/`uk` shipped the suspension's generic noun
 * (`Блокировка`/`Блокування`) with nothing to catch it.
 */

/**
 * [root meaning "ban", root meaning "suspend"] — lowercase stems, matched
 * case-insensitively (`Бан` at sentence start must still count). Each root is
 * the invariant substring across every grammatical form its state word takes
 * in this locale's state-describing copy (the STATE_PAIRS below — headings,
 * reasons, untils; NOT the shared action strings, where "appeal your ban"
 * would legitimately carry a root), and each is absent from the OTHER state's
 * copy — that absence is what makes the exclusion assertions meaningful.
 * Indonesian's suspend-root is `angguh` because the stem `tangguh`
 * nasal-mutates under prefixation: di+tangguh → ditangguhkan, but
 * peN+tangguh → peNangguhan.
